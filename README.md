## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run the **ReflectaHome** website on your local development environment:

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * PHP (version >= 7.4)
    * MySQL Server installed and running
    * Web server (Apache)

2. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sinoyolongavu/ecommerce-project.git
    cd ecommerce-project
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies (if using Composer):**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

4. **Database Setup:**
    * Create a new database named `reflectahome` in your MySQL server.
    * Import the database schema from the provided SQL file (`database/reflectahome.sql` - if applicable). You can do this using a MySQL client (like phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench) or the command line:
        ```bash
        mysql -u [your_mysql_username] -p reflectahome < database/reflectahome.sql
        ```
    * Configure the database connection details in your PHP configuration file (e.g., `config.php`, `.env`):
        ```php
        <?php
        define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
        define('DB_USER', 'your_db_user');
        define('DB_PASS', 'your_db_password');
        define('DB_NAME', 'reflectahome');
        ?>
        ```

5. **Web Server Configuration:**
    * Ensure your web server is configured to point to the project's `public` directory (or the main entry point of your application).
    * If using Apache, you might need to enable `mod_rewrite` and configure a `.htaccess` file (if provided).

6. **Run the Development Server (Example using PHP's built-in server):**
    ```bash
    php -S localhost:8000 -t public
    ```
    Then, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
